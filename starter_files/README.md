# Machine Learning Pipeline Building using Azure AutoML

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.
This project aimed to using machine learning to predict the potential customers for bank marketing based on the given data of potential customer's characteristics. 
It used Azure as a cloud platfrom to build an auto machine learning pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.
1) automated ML experiment: run an automated ML experiment to search for and optimized a best model
2) deploy the best model: deploy the best model for future consumption
3) enable logging: create the logging for the automated run 
4) swagger documentation: use swagger as a tool for easier documentation of how to consume the endpoints via http requests
5) consume model endpoints: consume the endpoint by sending http request to use the best model to make predictions based on new input data
6) create publish and consume a pipeline: a pipeline was created and published for future consumption of the endpoint


## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps.

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
